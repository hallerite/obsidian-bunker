# Obsidian Bunker

Obsidian is great software that is built on the principle of 'file over app'. This is why it uses the `.md` format, which is widely used and *open*. You can look at the contents of the file using any text editor of your choice.

This is great â€” except when its not. If you can easily read this data, then so can everyone else who gets access to the file. There are many things that you want to keep to your self.

This is where **Bunker** comes in. It integrates with veracrypt and allows to mount a veracrypt partition to a folder.
